## Contributions

In this section we will discuss a summary of the contributions of each group member, and any issues which arose while collaborating.

### Ridwan Mukhtar

My main individual contribution to the project was the creation of the database. With help from Callum and Mark we managed to create it, however, this part was mostly entrusted to me to do. I also helped Callum and Mark when they got stuck with their queries, along with creating my own queries. Overall, I feel I contributed a fair amount and am happy with my colleaguesâ€™ contributions.

### Mark Schmieg

My main contribution was designing the database. I was tasked with designing how we would create the database. When I had some ideas on how the database should be, I created ER Diagrams which we later discussed and modified as a group. I helped Ridwan with the creation of the database and the loading of the data along with helping Callum with questions he had regarding task 1. I also did my fair share of the queries. Overall, I am happy with the work myself and my group members did.

### Callum Hayden

My main contribution was writing the report. I also wrote some queries and buckled down to help as a team when we were struggling with queries or unsure if they were correct. I helped whenever needed and I am extremely happy with my contribution as well as that of my team members.

## Task 1

*Familiarise yourself with the IMDB data subset and provide an overview of the entities and how they are linked (e.g. Entity Relationship Diagram).*

*Details of entities, links, and other information provided gets us the full marks (4-5)*

IMDB, also known as the Internet Movie Database, is an online database which stores data related to films, tv shows, video games, etc. In this coursework, we are focusing on a subset of the IMDB dataset which only includes information relating to films. The dataset was provided to us as part of the coursework and includes the following files:

* **actors.csv**

This file stores information relating to actors. It stores an id to identify them, a name, and a gender.

* **directors.csv**

This file stores information relating to directors. It stores an id to identify them, a name, and a rating amongst other things.

* **movies.csv**

This file stores information relating to films. It stores an id to identify them, the title of the movie, and the year it was released.

* **ratings.csv**

This file stores ratings for different movies. It stores a movie id to state which movie the rating is for, along with a rank out of ten, the number of votes the movie has received, and the distribution of votes/rank.

* **runningtimes.csv**

This file stores the length of different movies. It stores a movie id to link to a movie, a time and a time1 where they may be the same, but are used to distinguish different running times between versions, and an option version of the movie such as DVD or extended cut.

* **writers.csv**

This file stores information about the writers of films. It stores an ID along with a name for each writer.

* **moviestoactors.csv**

This file stores information which relates a movie to an actor. It stores a movie id and an actor id to match them with the movies and actors files, along with information about the role being played by the actor in the given movie, such as the character the actor played.

* **moviestodirectors.csv**

This file stores information which relates a movie to a director. It stores a movie id and a director id to match them with the movies and directors files. It also includes the genre of the movie.

* **moviestowriters.csv**

This file stores information which relates a movie to a writer. It stores a movie id and an writer id to match them with the movies and writers files. It also includes information about the written format of the movie, such as if it was a screenplay, if a writer was uncredited, or if it was based on a novel by the writer amongst other options.

In designing the graph database, we chose to create six nodes, one for movies, with five that have relationships with movies which are actors, directors, ratings and running time. These nodes store the following data:

* Movies

    * movieid

    * title

    * year

* Actors

    * actorid

    * name

    * sex

* Directors

    * directorid

    * name

    * rate

    * gross

    * num

* Rating

    * movieid

    * rank

    * votes

    * distribution

* Running Time

    * movieid

    * time

    * addition

    * time1

* Writers

    * writerid

    * name

Movies are connected through edges, some of which, contain data of their own. These are:

* Movies are *directed_by* directors

    Stores the data from the moviestodirectors.csv file. It allows for linking movies to directors based on a movieid and a directorid. The data stored is:

    * movieid

    * directorid

    * genre

* Movies *cast* actors

    Stores the data from the moviestoactors.csv file. It allows for linking movies to actors based on a movieid and an actorid. The data stored is:

    * movieid

    * actorid

    * as_character

    * leading

* Movies are *written_by* writers

    Stores the data from the moviestowriters.csv file. It allows for linking movies to writers based on a movieid and a writerid. The data stored is:

    * movieid

    * writerid

    * addition

* Movies *has_ratings* ratings

    Connects movies to ratings based on movieid.

* Movies *length* runningtimes

    Connects movies to runningtimes based on movieid.

This can be seen in the ER Diagram

## Task 2

*Load the data provided into Neo4J giving the details in your report on any data cleaning/transformations/checks/loading commands used. These should be detailed enough for someone else to implement given they know how to use Neo4J.*

*Full instructions on loading data with additional steps taken after loading dataset gets us full marks (8-10)*

After designing the database, we worked on creating the database. The first issue we encountered was with the formatting of the CSV file. We attempted to load data with this query:

```SQL
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///directors.csv" AS row FIELD RETURN row
```

Unfortunetly, this lead to a syntax error as neo4j did not understand how to sperate the data. This would have worked if each row of data was correctly formatted into columns, however, it was not.

We found two ways we could fix this issue. This first was to change the format of the CSV file to ensure all data was formatted correctly and as expected. The second was to change the query to include the terminator parameter, using ";" as the terminator. 

The solution we chose was to use the terminator so as not to edit the data as to the dataset only being a subset of the full IMDB dataset. If we chose to edit the data, then when adding the full database it may not work as expected.

The commands used to load the data can be found in the appendix. All of these commands should be ran to load all of the data files into the database.

Once the data files are loaded in, the next step is to create the graph itself. To do this we began by creating the nodes. The queries used can be found in the appendix, and the nodes created are the actors node, the directors node, the writers node and the movies node. We then created indexes for these nodes by using the code found in the appendix.

Once we had our nodes and their indexes, we needed a way to link them. To do this we created the relationships between the nodes, for example, the link between movies and writers. This link states that movies were written by a writer, and gives us a link between the nodes with which we can carry out queries involving both nodes. Some of these relationships such as that mentioned above links two nodes together, however, some create a new node such as the link between movies and rating, which creates a new rating node. The code for this can be found in the appendix.

We then tested the database by using some simple commands such as "call db.schema()" to see how the graph looked. The output to this query looks like so:

![Screenshot of output of call db.schema() command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CMHayden/NoSQL-Data-Storage/master/images/screenshotOfGraph.png?token=AFNT2CDPDJVD7IH2WXSWXMK6JQD7O)

And we also ran commands such as:

```SQL
MATCH(n:actors)
RETURN n
LIMIT 100
```

For each of our nodes. This returns the first 100 actors stored inside the actors node and is something we recommend to ensure the data is loaded as expected. You can remove the limit, however, the query may take a long time to run. Sample output should look similar to this:

![Output for 100 actors query](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CMHayden/NoSQL-Data-Storage/master/images/100Actors.png?token=AFNT2CCL7DHXDSO6ILXKDZC6JQFD6)

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we learnt how to truly collaborate. While it would have been easier to simply split up the queries into five each and get them done individually, we chose to attempt to collaborate. We used GitHub (private repository) to help with our collaboration and we attempted to all work on everything. The harder queries we sat together and attempted to figure them out between us which lead to a great experience of learning to be better team players. This also allowed us to discuss how we are doing queries, and which we believe would be the more efficient way of doing a query, along with all pitching in towards the design of the graph itself.

Apart from our soft skills, we all learnt massively about graph databases and enjoyed finding similarities between it with computing concepts we already know such as graph data structures, SQL and object-oriented programming. One of the biggest similarities found however was with JSON which helped a lot when thinking how write the complex queries.

We all got to learn and practice cypher syntax. From simple queries such as counting the amount of male actors, to more complex queries such as query 11 which matches multiple nodes and edges to get the required data.

Due to some ambiguity in the questions for task three, some of the queries have more than one answer as we did not want to make an assumption, which we believe is the correct thing to do.

--14: sets M as the movies, A as the actors starring in M and DIR as the di-rectors directing M. The query then finds the movies where an actor star-ring in movie M is also its director, and returns the total number of mov-ies with this case

MATCH (a:actors)<-[casts]-(m:movies)-[d:directed_by]->(dir: directors)
WHERE a.name = dir.name
RETURN count(m) AS MovieCount


--15: sets M as the movies, W as the writter who wrote movie M, as the direc-tor who directed M, A as the actors in the movie M and A2 as the list of all actors. This query goes through all the different movies and makes sure that the movie's director and the movie's writer are the same and make sure that none of the actors in the movies are the director/writer, then we also check the movie's director/writer is also an actor (just not in the movie currently queried)

MATCH (m:movies)-[c:casts]->(a:actors), (d:directors)<-[db:directed_by]-(m)-[written_by]->(w:writers), (a2:actors)
WHERE NOT a.name = d.name AND NOT w.name = a.name AND d.name = w.name AND a2.name = d.name
